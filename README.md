# Rune

A reference implementation of the rune protocol. The goal of this project is to find consensus around the rune protocol and implement an index.

## Testing

```
cargo test

## Example

Let's examine the hex of the first ordinalswallet rune tx. See https://mempool.space/api/tx/1aa98283f61cea9125aea58441067baca2533e2bbf8218b5e4f9ef7b8c0d8c30/hex

#### ScriptPubKey
The rune data is provided within the ScriptPubKey section, introduced by the OP_RETURN opcode, 0x6a. It is divided into substrings by OP_PUSHBYTES opcodes, here 0x01, 0x0b, 0x0a:
- 0601520b0001ff00752b7d000000000aff987806010000000012
= OP_RETURN 01 52 0b 0001ff00752b7d00000000 0a ff987806010000000012
-> datapush R, datapush transfer, datapush issuance

**R:** All rune tx start their ScriptPubKey with 1 pushbyte encoding the letter **R** in hex:
- 0x 01 52
= OP_PUSHBYTES_1 52
= R

**transfer:** This is followed by a **transfer** data push:
- 0x 0b 0001ff00752b7d00000000
= OP_PUSHBYTES_11 00 01 ff 00 75 2b 7d 00 00 00 00
= 00, 01, 00 00 00 00 7d 2b 75 00
= _ID (hex)_ 0, _OUTPUT (hex)_ 1, _AMOUNT (varint)_ 21000000

**issuance:** In a mint tx this is then followed by an additional **issuance** data push:
- 0x 0a ff987806010000000012
= OP_PUSHBYTES_10 ff 98 78 06 01 00 00 00 00 12
= 00 00 00 00 01 06 78 98, 12
= _SYMBOL (base26)_ RUNE, _DECIMALS (hex)_ 18

**Note** that the ordinalswallet implementation is encoding the _Symbol_ through Base64 and varint into little endian!
How to decode the _Symbol_ pushstring: ff 98 78 06 01 00 00 00 00
- 0xff tells us the next 8 bytes are little endian, which means we need to swap them around:
00 00 00 00 01 06 78 98
- This hex decodes to a decimal:
17201304
- Which in turn decodes to a character string via base26 with 00=A:
17 20 13 04
= RUNE
